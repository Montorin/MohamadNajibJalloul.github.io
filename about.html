			Hello! My name is Mohamad-Najib Jalloul, and I am a computer science student with a great passion for video games. I have studied C++, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my skills. I was born in Lebanon and moved to Canada when I was young. Currently, I reside in Montreal, Quebec.
		</p>
		<p>
			 am currently in the final semester of my associate's degree program, scheduled to complete on May 8th. I have a strong passion for learning, which led me to pursue computer science as my major. The field's rapidly evolving nature allows for continuous learning and communication with experienced professionals, fostering an ideal environment for knowledge acquisition and exchange.
		</p>
		<p>
			 I have gained significant expertise in object-oriented programming, which has enabled me to articulate solutions in a specialized manner. Currently, I am working on two personal projects with fellow students, where we have established a source control system using Git and repositories hosted on GitHub. This collaboration has provided me with valuable practical experience in project management and teamwork.
		</p>
		<p>
			 Overall, I am committed to pursuing ongoing education and development in computer science, and I am eager to apply my skills and expertise to real-world challenges in the field.
